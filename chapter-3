Chapter 3


They stood in on the outskirts of the crowd, standing on their tip-toes to see if they could spot the King or the Crown Prince. It was good to see so many of the people of Welles out in full force, ready for the proclamation.

"Hello," boomed the King.

"Hello!" screamed a child, before his mother clapped a hand over his mouth.

"Wellesians, we come from a distant land and we have come to this one, to live and prosper, to be kind and do good, to make merry. This has been our way for Five Hundred years, since the last wars of the Barbarians ended.

But," he said.

Rei blinked. This oratory was not going the way that she had anticipated.

"There are those who would threaten our ways," he began, shaking his head. "There are those who would invite Death in.

"Death is the enemy," Rei intoned.

"Words of those armed with knives, who would attack the peace of places like this. The scribes have been reporting darker and darker news from abroad...

As your King,

This is my decree. We will take up arms again against Death. We will take precautions. We will protect our people, our ways."

Rei blinked. The borders were getting darker, it was true, but it had not touched Welles as of yet. And the darkness that they spoke of did not seem like something you could take arms against. It was like a sickness that passed from person to person. It was not a person you could fight. What could they do?

"How will you protect us?" yelled a man in the crowd. Brave of him, she thought. It was not good to question the king, too much. But it was not good to not question him at all.
